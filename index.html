      <p>I was born in Centennial Colorado and moved to Fort Collins
      for school. Those are the only two places i've lived.

    <h1>Where I would like to visit</h1>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Helsinki</stong><li>
        <li><em>New Orleans</em></li>
        <li><strong>Prague</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        I think Helsinki would be a blast to visit because I have
        never been to anywhere even kinda close. There is also a
        very happening music scene there. New Orleans also has an
        awesome music scene, and a ton of culture and history. Last but
        not least, I would really like to go back to Prague one day.
        Ive been there before but would really like another chance to
        check it out and explore.
